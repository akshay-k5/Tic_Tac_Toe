# Tic_Tac_Toe

This project presents a Tic-Tac-Toe AI powered by the Minimax algorithm with
DFS , which enables the AI to evaluate game states efficiently, predict outcomes,
and choose the best moves while minimizing computational costs.
The Minimax algorithm simulates all possible moves for both players,
considering their strategies to determine the optimal outcome. However,
evaluating every possible game state can be computationally intensive, especially
for complex games.

This implementation aims to demonstrate the application of game theory and
search optimization techniques in solving adversarial problems. It provides a
robust and efficient AI capable of consistently making moves, showcasing its
potential for broader applications in game design, competitive AI, and decisionmaking systems.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The game has two players:
>> 1. User (Player): Symbol is "X".
>> 2. AI (Computer): Symbol is "O".
>> 3. User can input row and column number for playing.
## The goal is to:
>> - Let the user and AI take turns playing.
>> - Identify win conditions, draw conditions, and valid moves.
>> - Implement an AI that makes optimal moves using the Minimax algorithm.
>> - User can enter preferred location for 'X' by specifing row number and column number.
